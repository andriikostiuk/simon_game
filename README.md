## SIMON GAME (Rainbow Master)

Rainbow Master is my personal version of famous Simon Game.

Play here: https://andriikostiuk.github.io/simon_game/

Rules are from classic version.
Difference: you can change difficulty level: 
    * classic (4 colors);
    * 5 colors;
    * 6 colors;
    * Rainbow Master (7 colors).
Also you can change mode: normal or strict. More information you can find in Rules section.

I used comprehensive SVG elements and trigonometric functions in this project to create dynamic buttons of unusual shapes with sound effects.
